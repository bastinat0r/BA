\section{Finken Robots}

The Finken project aims to create a swarm of autonomously flying quadrocopters to research swarm intelligence beheaviour on robots.
Many algorithems in swarm intelligence are based on distance-values. \todo{source}
For this reason it is reasonable to search for a sensor that is capable to measure distances and integrate it into the Finken robots. 

The Finken robots are already existing and of course it is necessary to know wich kind of hardware on the robots could interfere with the ranging sensors that shall be integrated into those robots.

\begin{itemize}
	\item[IMU] Inertial Measurement Unit with accelerometer, magnetometer and barometer
	\item[Sonar Sensors] Sonar sensors to measure distances of the nearest object in four directions (front, back, left, right)
	\item[IR-Sensor] Sensor to measure distance to ground with high frequency
	\item[Optical Flow] Optical flow sensor, that can be integrated to measure x-y-velocity over ground
	\item[Motors] Four brushless motors that may cause RF-interfercene and noise
	\item[Telemetry] BTLE-/Zigbee modules to exchange data with the ground station
	\item[RC-Control] 2.4GHz based Radio Control to manually control the robots
	\item[Power-Supply] Lithium polymer batteries with nominally 6.6V \todo{fink3?} output voltage that is converted to 5V and 3.3V by the power distribution hardware
	\item[Payload] The overall weight of the copter in the current configuration is about \todo{weight}g with about \todo{payload}g headroom for additional equipment
	\item[Size] The copter has a rotor to rotor distance of 10cm, and a sensor tower that is about 4cm by 4cm wide to use the existing mounting holes would be favourable
\end{itemize}

\section{Evaluation of Existing Ranging Solutions}
There are some technologies that can be used for ranging, however the usual application for most of those technologies in research is positioning.
For that reason it is interesting to search for ranging applications that are used in positioning, while we are only interested in the ranging part. \todo{better wording needed}
There however different methods to measure positions that are not using range measurements.\footnote{The usual methods for positioning are multilateral—which is what we are interested in because only ranging measurments are used, multiangular—which is no use  to us, because angle measurements are used and by orientating in a map with different factors like beacon-positions–which is also no use to us.}

The usual technologies used for ranging are based on time of flight measurments, signal strength, optical tracking, and phase diffence measurments in signals.
