The FINken robot platform is used to research intelligent swarm behaviour.
To implement such behaviour a new sensor is needed to measure the distance between the FINken quadcopters.
The Atmel Ranging Toolbox was used to create a sensor measuring this distance.

After the implementation the influence of different factors on the system was determined to find out if the sensor will be integrated into the FINken robot.
Additionally, it was analysed how well the properties of a distance function apply to the measured range values.

The sensor is not fully suitable for the use in the FINken robots in its current form.
However, some strategies to improve the quality of the measured data are suggested.
