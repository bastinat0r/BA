The FINken robot platform shall be used to research intelligent swarm behaviour.
To implement such behaviour a new sensor is needed to measure the distance between quadcopters.
The Atmel Ranging Toolbox was used to create a sensor measuring this distance.

After implementation the influence of different factors on the system was determined to find out if the sensor shall be integrated into the FINken robot.
Additionally an anlysis was made on how well the properties of a distance function apply to the measured range values.

The sensor is not fully suitable to be used in the FINken robots in its current form.
However some methods to improve the quality of the measured data and for filtering the data have been found.
