\section{Robustness of Implementation}

For use in the FINken robots not only the quality of the measurements is relevant.


\subsection{Bus hangup}
I2C is an easy to implement and use bus protocol.
One of the drawbacks of I2C is that misbehaving clients are able to block the whole bus.

At the moment the ranging sensors cause bus hangups, when rangings are requested to often.

\subsection{i2c errors per time}
Another problem that may occure is that i2c data packets can get lost.

\section{Ranging Accuracy}

\subsection{Frequency Selection}
The frequencys used by the ranging can be chosen.
Especially because normal 2.4GHz wifi and serveral other technologies are using the same frequencys as the ranging modules the selection of a well working one is crucial to ranging performance.

\subsection{Influence of DQF on Range Values}
One value the ranging api provides is the DQF\footnote{Data Quality Factor}-value.
It is reasonable to expect a huge amount of scatter for lower DQF values.
As \autoref{1m_scatterplot} shows this is not how the range value behaves.

For the values measured with 1m real distance we can see that the values measered with lower quality do not have the same mean value as those with higher quality.
Also values measured with lower quality are closer to each other than those with higher signal quality.
As long as we only look at the values taken at 1m real distance it seams like we could be able to improve the range estimate by including the dqf value into the computation of the distance.
To do that this behaviour would need to be stable accross different distances, i.e. no matter if the measurement is taken at 1m or 3m distance the when the dqf is low the measured range is lower and if dqf is high the measured range is higher.

\autoref{range_05_to_2m} shows measurements taken at different distances.
The values for further distances have far more noise than values for lower distances. \todo{Porvide variance/mse values for all ranges}

\section{Properties of a Distance Function}
The ranging sensor on the FINken robot shall be used to provide a distance between two quadcopters, similar to a distance measure used in swarm intelligence algorithms.
In the pure mathematical sense a distance function has to fullfill certian properties.

If $f(x, y)$ is a distance function it has to have the following properties.
\begin{eqnarray}
f(x, y) \ge 0 \\
f(x, y) = 0 \iff x = y \\ 
f(x, y) = f(y, x) \\ 
f(x, z) \le f(x, y) + f(y, z)
\end{eqnarray}

Of course the value measured by any real sensor will not completly accomplish to satisfy those conditions.
For use in swarm robotics it is therefore very interesting to know in which way the range values break the pattern of a mathematical distance function.

\subsection{Non-negativity and Coincidence}

The first property of a mathematical distance measure to look at is non-negativity. This is quite easy: The values yielded by the ranging modules are clearly positiv.
Also the property of coincidence is always given.
Each module has a unique address and is therefore able to check, if it is ranging itself.
Having two modules occupy the same physical spot is obviosly not possible so there cannot be two different modules that are equvivalent in a mathematical sense.
