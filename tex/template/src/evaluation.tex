\subsection{Influence of DQF on Range Values}
One value the ranging api provides is the DQF\footnote{Data Quality Factor}-value.
It is reasonable to expect a huge amount of scatter for lower DQF values.
As \autoref{1m_scatterplot} shows this is not how the range value behaves.

For the values measured with 1m real distance we can see that the values measered with lower quality do not have the same mean value as those with higher quality.
Also values measured with lower quality are closer to each other than those with higher signal quality.
As long as we only look at the values taken at 1m real distance it seams like we could be able to improve the range estimate by including the dqf value into the computation of the distance.
To do that this behaviour would need to be stable accross different distances, i.e. no matter if the measurement is taken at 1m or 3m distance the when the dqf is low the measured range is lower and if dqf is high the measured range is higher.

\autoref{range_05_to_2m} shows measurements taken at different distances.
The values for further distances have far more noise than values for lower distances. \todo{Porvide variance/mse values for all ranges}

\section{Properties of a Distance Function}
The ranging sensor on the FINken robot shall be used to provide a distance between two quadcopters, similar to a distance measure used in swarm intelligence algorithms.
In the pure mathematical sense a distance function has to fullfill certian properties.

If $f(x, y)$ is a distance function it has to have the following properties.
\begin{eqnarray}
f(x, y) \ge 0 \\
f(x, y) = 0 \iff x = y \\ 
f(x, y) = f(y, x) \\ 
f(x, z) \le f(x, y) + f(y, z)
\end{eqnarray}

Of course the value measured by any real sensor will not completly accomplish to satisfy those conditions.
For use in swarm robotics it is therefore very interesting to know in which way the range values break the pattern of a mathematical distance function.
